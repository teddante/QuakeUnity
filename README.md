# QuakeUnity
Welcome to QuakeUnity, an open-source Unity-based reimplementation of the legendary first-person shooter, Quake. We aim to faithfully recreate the classic Quake experience while leveraging the power, flexibility, and accessibility of the Unity engine.

## Overview
This project's main objective is to translate the original Quake's C source code into Unity-compatible C# scripts, preserving the original mechanics and gameplay as much as possible while providing room for new features, enhancements, and mod support.

## Contributions
QuakeUnity is open to contributions from everyone. If you are passionate about Quake, Unity, or game development in general, you are more than welcome to contribute to this project. Be it through code, bug reports, documentation, or ideas, every contribution helps us recreate and enrich the classic Quake experience.
